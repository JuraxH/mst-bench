  - description of one specific algorithm


* our presentation
  - 16x10 - slides 4:3
  - describe the problem
  - high level description of random KKT and boruvka
  - table of time complexity (maybe space also)
  - describe how we created graphs
  - table of results
  - compute the coeficient for random KKT and compare with others
  - briefly about implementation (cpp, boost, bgl)
  - shout out argparse and my mother
  - at the end leave some nice graph for discusion
