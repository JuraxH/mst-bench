Graphs were taken from
[xavierwoo](https://github.com/xavierwoo/Dynamic-MST/blob/master/instances/ReadMe.txt).
There is one graph per file and each line in file represents an edge using the
following notation '(source node) (target node) (weight)', additionally the
first line has the following format '(number of nodes) (number of edges)'.
